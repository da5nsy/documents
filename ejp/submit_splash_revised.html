      Now that you have received the reviews back from Review Commons, you will be able to instruct Review Commons to post the reviews to bioRxiv and to submit the manuscript with its reviews to one of the affiliate journals.
    </p>
    <p class=" ">
      The next steps in the Review Commons process are the following:
      <ol type="disc">
        <li>
          <strong>Upload a response to reviewers:</strong> please upload an initial response to reviewers/revision plan within <strong>4 weeks</strong> upon receipt of your reviews. If you transfer your manuscript to an affiliate journal (see step #3 below), this document will be useful to the editors who will make a decision based on the transferred Review Commons reviews. You can also upload an additional initial revision of the manuscript with all track changes visible. The original file cannot be modified at this stage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Posting of the reviews on bioRxiv:</strong> to post the reviews and your response on bioRxiv, you will be asked to supply the doi of your bioRxiv preprint. If you want to also post a reply alongside the reviews, you will be asked to copy and paste the content of the letter directly in a dedicate text box online.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transfer to affiliate journals:</strong> once the initial response to reviewers/revision plan has been uploaded, you will be able to access a screen that lets you select the affiliate journal to which you want to submit you manuscript with its reviews and response letter. Please note that the full set of reviews will be transferred by the system as well as your response and the original manuscript. If you elected to upload an initial revision, it will be transferred alongside the original version.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evaluation at affiliates:</strong>upon transfer, the recipient journal will consider the manuscript as a formal submission and use the transferred reviews and your response/revision plan to make an initial decision. <strong>Note that while it is under consideration at an affiliate journal, the manuscript cannot be transferred to any other affiliates.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New rounds of transfer</strong>: if the journal declines, you will be informed by the journal. The manuscript will then be unlocked on the Review Commons site so that you can initiate a new transfer. <strong> Please note that the maximal number of transfer is limited to 3 rounds.</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p class=" ">
      After pressing the "Continue" button below, you will be presented with successive screens:</span></span>
    </p> 
    <ol start="1" type="1"> 
      <li class=" ">
        <strong>Files:</strong> Allows you to upload your response letter/revision plan.
      </li> 
      <li class=" ">
        <strong>Manuscript Information: </strong>Allows you to enter the doi of the bioRxiv preprint and indicate whether you wish to post the reviews alongside the preprint. Manuscript information such as Title, Authors, etc. are also available in this section.
      </li> 
      <li class=" ">
        <strong>Validate: </strong>Provides you with an opportunity to review your submitted information and make changes as necessary. You will also be prompted at this point to fill in any missing information.
      </li> 
      <li class=" ">
        <strong>Submit: </strong>Once the validation process is complete, you will be able to submit and reach the screen that lets you select an affiliate journal for transferring the manuscript, the reviews and your response letter.</span></li> 
    </ol> 
    <p class=" ">
      Note that navigating through this tab view will save any entered information each time a new tab is clicked (or the boxes "Save and Continue" and "Next" are clicked).
